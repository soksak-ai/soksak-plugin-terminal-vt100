# soksak-plugin-terminal-vt100

Soksak terminal plugin backed by the VT100 terminal-state sidecar.

The plugin implements `soksak-spec-plugin-terminal` 0.0.1, declares PTY and terminal-state
sidecar requirements, and exposes the common terminal commands, status and operable nodes. The
published plugin archive contains `plugin.json`, `main.js` and its license; provider binaries are
installed independently.
